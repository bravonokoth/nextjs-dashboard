# Next.js Dashboard

This project is a simple and responsive dashboard built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It provides a flexible layout with a sidebar navigation component (`SideNav`) that can be reused across different pages. The dashboard uses a layout component to wrap and organize the content dynamically.

The layout ensures a responsive design, with a side navigation bar on larger screens and a main content area that adjusts based on screen size. The sidebar can be expanded or collapsed depending on the screen size, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Key features:
- **Responsive design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Reusable components:** The sidebar (`SideNav`) and layout components are reusable across pages.
- **Page structure:** A sample page (`Dashboard`) is provided to demonstrate how content is rendered within the layout.
- **Next.js setup:** Utilizes the latest Next.js features like React Server Components, automatic static optimization, and fast refresh for an efficient development experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first CSS framework)
- **TypeScript** (For type safety and better development experience)
- **React** (UI components)

This project serves as a basic foundation for building dashboard-style applications with modern web development practices.
